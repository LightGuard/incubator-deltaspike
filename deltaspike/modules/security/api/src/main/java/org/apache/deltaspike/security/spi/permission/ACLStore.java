 * Denotes an entity bean (i.e. a class annotated with @Entity) as being a storage container
 * for object permissions.  If the value member is set, then the annotated entity will be used
 * to lookup object permissions for objects of that class only, otherwise if it is not set the
 * entity will be used to store general object permissions (only one entity may be used for
 * general permissions, if more than one entity is defined then a deployment exception will be
